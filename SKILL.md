## Overview

Manage your Alpaca Markets trading account using the `alpaca` CLI tool and Python SDK. Supports both paper trading (simulated) and live trading.

## Installation

### Recommended: Homebrew Python (avoids urllib3/LibreSSL warnings)

```bash
# Install Homebrew Python 3.11+
brew install python@3.11

# Install alpaca-py
/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3.11 install alpaca-py pytz
```

### Alternative: System Python

```bash
pip3 install alpaca-py pytz
```

**Note:** System Python may show urllib3 warnings on macOS due to LibreSSL compatibility. Use Homebrew Python for a cleaner experience.

## Configuration

### Quick Setup with CLI

```bash
alpaca auth
```

This will interactively prompt you for:
- API Key
- Secret Key (hidden input)
- Trading mode (Paper or Live)

The command automatically saves your credentials to your shell config file (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.profile`).

### Manual Setup

Alternatively, set these in your shell profile manually:

```bash
export ALPACA_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export ALPACA_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
export ALPACA_PAPER="true"  # Use "false" for live trading
```

Get your API keys from https://alpaca.markets (Dashboard → API Keys)

**Paper Trading** (recommended for testing):
- Use paper trading API keys
- Virtual $100,000 starting balance
- No real money at risk

**Live Trading** (real money):
- Use live trading API keys
- Real money, real risk
- Test thoroughly with paper trading first

## Agent Usage

When the user asks about their portfolio or wants to trade:

1. **Configure credentials**: Run `alpaca auth` for first-time setup
2. **Check market status**: Run `alpaca clock` to see if market is open
3. **Check account**: Run `alpaca account` to see current balance and buying power
4. **Get positions**: Run `alpaca positions` to list current holdings
5. **View orders**: Run `alpaca orders` to see pending/recent orders
6. **Get quotes**: Run `alpaca quote <symbols>` to check current prices
7. **Place orders**: Run `alpaca buy/sell` to execute trades
8. **Manage risk**: Run `alpaca cancel/close` commands as needed

## Safety Tips

- **Always test with paper trading first** (`ALPACA_PAPER=true`)
- Use `alpaca auth` to safely configure credentials (secret key is hidden)
- Check `alpaca clock` before trading to see if market is open
- Check quotes before placing orders to understand current prices
- Check `account.buying_power` before placing orders
- Use `TimeInForce.DAY` to auto-cancel unfilled orders at market close
- Monitor positions regularly with `alpaca positions`
- Check order status with `alpaca orders`
- Review portfolio performance with `alpaca history`
- Use `alpaca cancel-all` to quickly cancel all pending orders
- Use `alpaca close-all` with caution (requires confirmation)
- Set stop-loss orders for risk management
- Never share your API keys publicly

## Market Hours

US stock market hours (Eastern Time):
- **Regular hours**: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
- **Pre-market**: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET
- **After-hours**: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM ET

Use `alpaca clock` to check current market status.

## Troubleshooting

### urllib3 Warning (LibreSSL)

If you see:
```
NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+, currently using LibreSSL
```

**Solution:** Install and use Homebrew Python 3.11+ which uses OpenSSL:
```bash
brew install python@3.11
/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3.11 install alpaca-py pytz
```

Then update the script shebang to use Homebrew Python:
```bash
sed -i '' '1s|#!/usr/bin/env python3|#!/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.11|' ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/alpaca-py-cli/scripts/alpaca
```

### Missing pytz

If you see:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pytz'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip3 install pytz
# or
/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3.11 install pytz
```

### Command Not Found

If `alpaca` command is not found, use the full path:
```bash
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/alpaca-py-cli/scripts/alpaca
```

Or add to PATH in your shell config:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.openclaw/workspace/skills/alpaca-py-cli/scripts:$PATH"
```

## Files

- **CLI Tool**: `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/alpaca-py-cli/scripts/alpaca`
- **Config**: Environment variables in `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`)

## Initialization (For Agents)

### Quick Setup with `alpaca init`

When a user needs to set up Alpaca trading, simply run:

```bash
alpaca init
```

**The CLI will:**
- Check if already configured
- Detect agent capabilities (email access, browser automation)
- Choose automatic or manual setup mode
- Guide the user through registration step-by-step
- Collect and save API keys
- Verify the setup

**Agent's Role:**
- Run `alpaca init` when user wants to start trading
- Let the CLI handle all the guidance and prompts
- The wizard is designed to be self-explanatory
- After completion, verify with `alpaca clock`

**Example:**
```
User: "I want to start trading stocks"
Agent: "I'll help you set up Alpaca paper trading (virtual money, no risk)."
       *runs: alpaca init*
       *follows the wizard's prompts*
Agent: "✓ Setup complete! You have $100,000 in paper money to practice with."
```

The `init` wizard handles all the complexity - agents just need to run it and follow along.
