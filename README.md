# Alpaca Trading (Python CLI) - OpenClaw Agent Skill

> **🤖 AI Agent Skill for OpenClaw**  
> Enable your AI agent to trade stocks and crypto via Alpaca Markets API using natural language commands.

> **⚠️ SECURITY NOTICE**  
> This skill requires **user interaction** for setup. Setup modifies shell configuration files and stores API keys as environment variables. Do NOT run `alpaca init` autonomously without user consent.

## 🤖 What is this?

This is an **OpenClaw Agent Skill** that gives your AI assistant the ability to:
- Check stock prices and market status
- Manage your trading portfolio
- Execute buy/sell orders
- View trading history and performance
- **Set up Alpaca accounts with guided wizard** (requires user interaction)
- All through natural language conversation!

**Example conversation:**
```
You: "I want to start trading stocks"
Agent: "I'll help you set up Alpaca paper trading. This requires your input."
       "The setup will save API keys to your shell config. Is that okay?"
User: "Yes"
Agent: *runs: alpaca init*
       *user follows prompts and enters keys*
Agent: "✓ Setup complete! You have $100,000 in virtual money."

You: "What's the current price of Apple stock?"
Agent: *runs alpaca quote AAPL* "AAPL is trading at $250.32"

You: "Buy 10 shares"
Agent: *runs alpaca buy AAPL 10* "✓ Order placed for 10 shares of AAPL"
```

## ⚠️ Security & Setup Requirements

**IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE INSTALLING:**

### What Happens During Setup

When you run `alpaca init`:
1. CLI prompts you to enter API keys interactively
2. Keys are saved to shell startup files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, or ~/.profile)
3. This creates persistent environment variables (ALPACA_API_KEY, ALPACA_SECRET_KEY, ALPACA_PAPER)
4. These variables are accessible to all processes in your shell

### Security Considerations

✅ **Good:**
- API keys stored as environment variables (standard practice)
- Secret key input is hidden during entry
- Paper trading by default (virtual money, no risk)
- User must explicitly enter keys (not auto-fetched)

⚠️ **Be Aware:**
- Keys in shell config are accessible to any process in that shell
- Agents with shell access can read environment variables
- Setup modifies your shell configuration files
- Changes persist across terminal sessions

### Recommended Practices

1. **Run setup manually** - Do not let agents run `alpaca init` autonomously
2. **Use paper trading keys** - Test with virtual money first ($100k)
3. **Review before consent** - Understand what files will be modified
4. **Least privilege** - Use API keys with minimal required permissions
5. **Monitor activity** - Check your Alpaca account regularly
6. **Secure your shell** - Protect files like ~/.zshrc from unauthorized access

### For Agent Developers

**Do NOT:**
- Run `alpaca init` or `alpaca auth` without explicit user permission
- Modify shell configuration files autonomously
- Store or transmit user API keys

**DO:**
- Inform user that setup will modify shell configuration
- Explain that API keys will be stored as environment variables
- Get explicit user consent before proceeding
- Let the user run setup commands themselves when possible

## 🤖 For AI Agents

This skill is designed specifically for AI agents like OpenClaw:

**Agent workflow:**
1. User asks to trade or check stocks
2. Agent runs appropriate `alpaca` command
3. Agent interprets output
4. Agent responds in natural language

**Setup workflow:**
1. User wants to start trading
2. Agent runs `alpaca init`
3. CLI guides user through registration
4. Agent confirms setup is complete

**Token-efficient design:**
- Minimal SKILL.md (low token usage when loaded)
- Detailed guidance shown at runtime (not in skill file)
- Clear, parseable CLI output
- Agent just needs to know which commands to run
